/**
 *
 * Often data is almost-sortedâ€”for example, a server receives timestamped stock quotes and earlier quotes may arrive slightly after later quotes
 * because of differences in server loads and network routes. In this problem we address efficient ways to sort such data. Write a program which takes
 * as input a very long sequence of numbers and prints the numbers in sorted order. Each number is at most k away from its correctly sorted position.
 * (Such an array is sometimes referred to as being k-sorted). For example, no number in the sequence {3,-1,2,6,4,5,8} is more than 2 away from its final sorted position.
